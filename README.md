# Security Controller
We mainly study the malicious behavior detection technology based on SDN. Based on SDN feature, we proposed a software define security architecture with centralized security control, in which, security appliances could get global view of the network, security intelligent information could be analyzed centrally, security services could be orchestrated and deployed on demand. Then we design and implement the malicious behavior detection mechanism in SDN environment , which provides strong support for retrospective and forensic evidence of malicious behavior in cloud environment.
